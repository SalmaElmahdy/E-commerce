# pytest

>> coverage run -m pytest 
"Use the coverage tool to run the pytest module with coverage analysis."
This command will execute your Python tests using pytest while tracking which parts of your code are being executed.
After the tests are complete, you can generate a coverage report to see the percentage of code coverage and identify
areas that might need more testing.

create new folder called htmlcov which contain "index.html" file  which told what tests need to be run


>> pytest --cov    
show above report in terminal instead of in index.html
